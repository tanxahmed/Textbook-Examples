 * (Financial application: calculate future investment value) Write a program that

 * the future investment value using the following formula:
 * futureInvestmentValue =
 * investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears*12
 * For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number
 * of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98.ï¿½
